Their docs is one huge unreadable page so I used AI to seperate it into pages and a navbar. It half did the job in true AI fashion, but is now some what readable without 128GB of RAM.

This won't be maintained and is essentially just a hacky workaround until 1min.ai fixes their actual docs / makes it actually loadable on any reasonably specced computer.
